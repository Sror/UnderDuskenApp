				The International Student Festival in
				Trondheim (ISFiT) gathers students
				from all over the world from February
				7th until the 17th. The festival is made
				possible by the volunteer effort of 400
				committed Trondheim students. The
				dialogue groups at ISFiT invite students
				from different sides of conflicts to talk
				together. The students this year come
				from Burundi, Armenia, Azerbaijan,
				and Sri Lanka.
				ISFiT President Kaja Juul Skarbø
				is proud of the dialogue work, which
				she believes takes the concept of ISFiT a step further and makes the festival a
				peacebuilder.
				– The dialogue groups gather the
				young, most committed enthusiasts
				from conflict areas so that they can
				get an understanding of the other side
				and exchange ideas that they can bring
				home.

				<strong>Neutral ground at Røros</strong><br>
				The dialogue groups gather at Røros ten
				days before the festival starts. Head of
				dialogue Beate Nesje at ISFiT says it is
				important for the participants to get to
				know each other well.
				– Dialogue requires openness. At
				Røros they meet on neutral ground and
				share the experience of the new environment,
				shocked by the cold and the snow.
				She believes the biggest challenge might be to get the students to open up.
				– It is difficult to be honest with the
				enemy. Before going to Røros we are
				going to visit the Norwegian parliament
				in Oslo, to show the students that this is
				an open and free country.
				According to Dialogue facilitator
				Marius Jones at ISFiT, the personal
				stories will be important. Together
				with a colleague he is going to lead the
				students from Sri Lanka throughout the
				gathering.
				– It will be exciting to hear about
				the conflicts from all the sides. In Sri
				Lanka they have very different perceptions
				about what is held to be true. So,
				it is very important that they listen to
				each other.
				As conversation managers, Jones
				says it is very important to be neutral,
				even though many of the participants
				might expect them to act as arbiters in
				the conflicts.
				– It can be difficult to talk about
				established truths, views which the
				participants often have been holding
				since they were kids. It will be exciting
				to see how people react, and if their views
				change.

				<strong> Cabin hike reaching new heights</strong>
				Former Head of dialogue Martin
				Sveinssønn Melvær at ISFiT 2011, and
				Dialogue facilitator at ISFiT 2009, recounts
				the Røros gatherings as fantastic
				experiences.
				– Being on a cabin hike can be nice
				in itself, but the gatherings at Røros
				brought the trip to a new high. All
				emotions were amplified, and there
				was an extremely intense mood. In 2011,
				the students from Rwanda in particular
				raised the atmosphere, which intensified
				the power of the dialogue. In 2009
				we had greater challenges and a tenser
				mood with Israelis and Palestinians, due
				to the Gaza war a few weeks earlier.
				He mentions a cultural evening
				during ISFiT 2009, in which participants
				from the different sides were to
				present their respective cultures.
				– Some participants used a map
				that appeared invalid in the eyes of the
				others. They had not considered the
				potential provocation. This serves to
				show how small issues can elicit strong
				emotional responses.

				<strong> Successful cooperation with
					Nansen Dialogue </strong>

					Head of dialogue Nesje says ISFiT has
					an intimate cooperation with Nansen
					Dialogue Network at Nansenskolen at
					Lillehammer. Students have had three
					seminars prior to the festival, in which they received tutoring in dialogue as a
					method for peace building. The students
					have visited the chosen conflict areas as
					well.
					– This way, we have been given a
					proper familiarity with the conflicts. We
					have asked critical questions and have
					seen the conflicts in a light different from
					what the media and the experts report.
					Senior advisor Steinar Bryn at
					Nansen Centre for Peace and Dialogue
					says it is inspiring to see other groups in
					Norway use dialgoue as a working tool
					and a means of reconciliation.
					– It is great to see the students commiting
					themselves. Unlike other student
					festivals, ISFiT makes a refreshing
					effort with something meaningful and
					substantial.
					Bryn thinks ISFiT is contributing to
					improving relations between different
					sides of serious conflicts, but believes the
					follow-up could have been better.
					– During the lengthy gathering at
					Røros, where the participants can get to know each other, there are great opportunities
					for achievements, much more
					than with just a meeting. The work that
					is being done deserves more funding for
					following-up.

				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Challenging follow-up</strong>
					Former Head of dialogue Melvær agrees
					that the work with following-up can be
					greatly improved.
					– The goal is to make a basis for
					something more after ISFiT, and with
					so little time, this is challenging. Thus,
					it is important to use the same areas of
					conflict several years in a row, and create
					a network by using earlier participants.
					He found the follow-up seminar in
					Armenia and Azerbaijan the summer
					after the 2011 festival to be very good,
					but the goal was for participants to start
					projects on their own in their home
					countries.
					– We have not seen a project yet, but
					when the participants met again, they
					had a more reflected view of the conflict.
					BRING A FRIEND: ISFiT President Kaja Juul Skarbø believes that by inspiring individuals to minor actions, the dialogue groups can produce great changes.
					They acknowledged that the other side
					were not as bad as they thought.
					He emphasises the cooperation with
					Nansenskolen as essential.
					– We could not have justified the
					dialogue work without the tutorials from
					Nansen Dialogue. It is great that they
					value the cooperation.

				</p>

				<p>
					<strong> From the smallest beginnings</strong>
					Nesje says ISFiT plans for a follow-up
					seminar in the participants’ home countries
					this summer.
					– We wish for the students to have
					resources to create a network in their
					home country with organizations
					working with peace, so that they can
					keep up the effort.
					Juul Skarbø believes that by inspiring
					individuals to minor actions, the
					dialogue groups as a whole can produce
					great changes, making an impact.
					– If all ISFiT participants bring a
					friend, we can ultimately create a large,
					sustainable network of dialogue.
